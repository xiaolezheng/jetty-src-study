=== Clustered Session Management: Infinispan

==== Enabling Infinispan Sessions

When using the Jetty distribution, you will first need to enable the `session-store-infinispan-remote` link:#startup-modules[module] for your link:#startup-base-and-home[Jetty base] using the `--add-to-start` argument on the command line.

$ java -jar ../start.jar --add-to-start=session-store-infinispan-remote

ALERT: There are enabled module(s) with licenses.
The following 1 module(s):
 + contains software not provided by the Eclipse Foundation!
 + contains software not covered by the Eclipse Public License!
 + has not been audited for compliance with its license

 Module: session-store-infinispan-remote

DOWNLD: http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/infinispan/infinispan-remote/7.1.1.Final/infinispan-remote-7.1.1.Final.jar to ${jetty.base}/lib/infinispan/infinispan-remote-7.1.1.Final.jar

COPY  : ${jetty.home}/modules/session-store-infinispan-remote/resources/hotrod-client.properties to ${jetty.base}/resources/hotrod-client.properties
INFO  : Base directory was modified
----

Doing this enables the remote Infinispan Session module and any dependent modules or files needed for it to run on the server.
The example above is using a fresh `${jetty.base}` with nothing else enabled.
Because Infinispan is not a technology provided by the Eclipse Foundation, users are prompted to assent to the licenses of the external vendor (Apache in this case).

When the `--add-to-start` argument was added to the command line, it enabled the the `session-store-infinispan-remote` module as well as the `sessions` and `server` modules, which are required for Infinispan session management to operate.
It also downloaded the needed Infinispan-specific jar files and created a directory named `${jetty.base}/lib/infinispan/` to house them.

In addition to adding these modules to the classpath of the server it also added several ini configuration files to the `${jetty.base}/start.d` directory.

____
[NOTE]
If you have updated versions of the jar files automatically downloaded by Jetty, you can place them in the associated `${jetty.base}/lib/` directory and use the `--skip-file-validation=<module name>` command line option to prevent errors when starting your server.

==== Configuring Infinispan Remote Properties

Opening the `start.d/session-store-infinispan-remote.ini` will show a list of all the configurable options for the Infinispan module:

[source, screen, subs="{sub-order}"]
----
# ---------------------------------------
# Module: session-store-infinispan-remote
# Enables session data store in a remote Infinispan cache
# ---------------------------------------
--module=session-store-infinispan-remote

#jetty.session.infinispan.remoteCacheName=sessions
#jetty.session.infinispan.idleTimeout.seconds=0
#jetty.session.gracePeriod.seconds=3600
#jetty.session.savePeriod.seconds=0
----

jetty.session.infinispan.remoteCacheName::
Name of the cache in Infinispan where sessions will be stored.
jetty.session.infinispan.idleTimeout.seconds::
Amount of time, in seconds, that the system allows the connector to remain idle before closing the connection.
jetty.session.gracePeriod.seconds::
Amount of time, in seconds, to wait for other nodes to be checked to verify an expired session is in fact expired throughout the cluster before closing it.
jetty.session.savePeriod.seconds=0::
By default whenever the last concurrent request leaves a session, that session is always persisted via the `SessionDataStore`, even if the only thing that changed on the session is its updated last access time.
A non-zero value means that the `SessionDataStore` will skip persisting the session if only the access time changed, and it has been less than `savePeriod` seconds since the last time the session was written.
+
____
[NOTE]
Configuring `savePeriod` is useful if your persistence technology is very slow/costly for writes.
In a clustered environment, there is a risk of the last access time of the session being out-of-date in the shared store for up to `savePeriod` seconds.
This allows the possibility that a node may prematurely expire the session, even though it is in use by another node.
Thorough consideration of the `maxIdleTime` of the session when setting the `savePeriod` is imperative - there is no point in setting a `savePeriod` that is larger than the `maxIdleTime`.

==== Configuring Embedded Infinispan Clustering

During testing, it can be helpful to run an in-process instance of Infinispan.
To enable this you will first need to enable the `session-store-infinispan-embedded` link:#startup-modules[module] for your link:#startup-base-and-home[Jetty base] using the `--add-to-start` argument on the command line.
